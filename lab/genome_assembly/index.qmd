## Background

The goal of this tutorial is to develop a pipeline for assembling viral genomes. The pipeline should include the following steps:

1. Retrieve sequencing data
2. Generate draft assemblies using two or more assemblers
3. Compare and assess the resulting contigs

### Tools and Environment Setup

- `edirect`
- `fastq-dump`
- `spades`
- `megahit`

## Retrieving Data

The data was generated from a sequencing experiment by The Pirbright Institute using REPLI-g kits (Qiagen). Five sequencing runs of five samples were conducted and the raw reads are stored under the project ID [PRJNA1066786](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1066786). The accession for each run is as follows:

- [SRR27644850](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX23312849[accn])
- [SRR27644851](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX23312848[accn])
- [SRR27644852](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX23312848[accn])
- [SRR27644853](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX23312848[accn])
- [SRR27644854](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX23312848[accn])
