## Goals

1. Understand how and where programs store data in memory
2. Learn how to make programs more efficient
3. Practice programming in a lower-level language
4. Learn about garbage collection

## Basics of C

The simplest C program is provided below. It is a function that returns an `int` which often denotes the exit code of the program. In UNIX systems, a return value of 0 indicates that the program ran without errors. Any other return value indicates an error, whether explicit or implicit.
```C
int main() {
  return 0;
}
```

The entry point of any C program is the `main` function.
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello, world!\n");
  return 0;
}
```

Comments are added by prepending a line with double forward slashes (`//`). Multi-line comments can be added as follows:
```C
// this is a comment
/* This
is a 
multi-line
comment
*/
```
