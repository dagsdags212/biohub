## What are Protein Embeddings?

According to UniProt, protein embeddings are a way to encode **functional** and **structural** properties of a protein in a machine-friendly format (vector representation). The characteristics of a protein are only learned from the sequence. The translation from sequence to embedding is computationally expensive, but the computed output can be amortized for different tasks, such as sequence similarity search, sequence clustering, and sequencing classification.

Protein embeddings typically consist of a vector representation, which captures the protein's properties and relationships with other proteins. Some common dimensions for protein embeddings include:

1. **Vector length**: 50-200 dimensions (e.g., 500-dimensional vectors)
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: to reduce the number of features while retaining essential information
3. **Biological relevance**: to ensure that the embedding is meaningful in the context of biology

## Applications

Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Networks
: Protein embeddings can help identify interactions between proteins by measuring the similarity between them.

Machine Learning
: Protein embeddings are used as input features for machine learning models to predict protein function, localization, or behavior.

Structural Biology
: Protein embeddings can provide insights into protein structure and dynamics by capturing their three-dimensional shapes and relationships.

## Generating Embeddings

Protein embeddings are typically generated using one of the following methods:

Spearman rank correlation
: Estimates the similarity between proteins based on the ranks they occupy across multiple datasets.

Cosine similarity
: Calculates the cosine similarity betwen two protein sequences or structures.

Deep learning-based methods
: Uses neural networks to learn embeddings from raw protein data, such as sequence or structure information
