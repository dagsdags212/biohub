### How to use NCBI datasets

[NCBI Datasets](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/docs/v2/download-and-install/) is a new resource designed by NCBI to gather data from across NCBI databases. The main entry point of the tool is the `datasets` command. Subcommands such as `download` or `summary` is then specified, followed by more subcommands to specify your query.

It seems to be the direction that NCBI wants to shepherd users towards. However, the nested structure of running the tool makes its use complicated and convoluted compared to other resources. NCBI is kind enough to give us a diagram for navigating the subcommands:

Swiftwater hydra (*Hydra vulgaris*) has a taxonomy id of `6087` and RefSeq id of `GCF_038396675.1`. We can download its genome by running the following:
```sh
datasets download genome accession GCF_038396675.1
```

By default, genome is downloaded as a zipped file named **ncbi_dataset**. The structure of the directory is seen below.
