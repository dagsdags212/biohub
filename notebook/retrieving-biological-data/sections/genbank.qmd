### Accessing Genbank

GenBank is the NIH genetic sequence database, an annotated collection of publicly available DNA sequences. If your data has a GenBank accession number such as `AF086833`, use the `bio fetch` command. By default, data is printed to stdout. Override this behavior by specifying the output filename with the `-o` flag or redirect the output to a file with the `>` operator.

```bash
# Accession id pointing to the record.
ACC=AF086833                                # <1>

# Specify output with a flag.
bio fetch ${ACC} --format fasta -o ${ACC}.fa # <2>

# Redirect the output to a file.
bio fetch ${ACC} --format gff > ${ACC}.gff  # <3>
```
1. Store accesssion ID as a variable.
2. Download the sequence (FASTA) file.
3. Download the annotation (GFF) file.

Let us verify the download by viewing the first ten lines of the annotation file:
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

! bio fetch AF086833 --format gff | head -n 10
```
