# Hidden Messages in the Replication Origin

In bacteria, short regions in the genome called **DnaA boxes** act as the binding site for _DnaA_ proteins to initiate replication. The function of these segments of DNA can be experimentally verified by wet-lab scientists. However, the process of motif discovery is often costly and is prone to systematic errors.

The observation that regulatory regions often contain short motifs make discovery amenable to computation techniques. I will be using the _Vibrio cholerae_ genome to illustrate some approaches to motif discovery.


## Genome Data

The genome for _Vibrio cholerae_ can be downloaded [here](https://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com/data/realdatasets/Replication/Vibrio_cholerae.txt).

Load and inspect the genome:
```{python}
filepath = "/home/dagsdags/gh-repos/biohub/data/vibrio-cholerae.txt"
with open(filepath, "r") as handle:
  genome = handle.read().strip()
  n = 80
  lines = [genome[i:i+n] for i in range(0, 300, n)]
  for line in lines:
    print(line)
```
