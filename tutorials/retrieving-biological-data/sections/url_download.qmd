### Download via URL

If you know the URL of a resource, you may use `wget` or `curl` to download the file. First, save the URL to a variable for referencing:
```bash
URL=http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-104/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.22.fa.gz
```

Use `curl`:
```bash
curl ${URL} -o chr22.fa.gz
```
  
Or use `wget`:
```bash
wget -nc ${URL} -o chr22.fa.gz
```

The `-nc` flag would skip the download altogether if the file already exists. Use this flag to ensure that large files are not overwritten.

For large files, [aria2](https://aria2.github.io/) can be used for faster, multi-segmented downloads. The tool also supports checkpoints which allow you to restart interrupted downloads. Download aria2 from their website or use `conda` to install in an environment.
```bash
aria2c ${URL} \ 
  -x 5 \           # <1>
  -o chr22.fa.gz   # <2>
```
1. Connect to the server with x connections.
2. Save the output to a file.
