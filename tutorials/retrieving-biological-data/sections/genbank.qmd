### How to access Genbank

GenBank is the NIH genetic sequence database, an annotated collection of publicly available DNA sequences. If your data has a GenBank accession number such as `AF086833` use the `fetch` command from the `bio` module.

```sh
# Create a directory for reference-related data
mkdir -p refs/

# Accession to be downloaded
ACC=AF086833

# Retrieve FASTA file
bio fetch ${ACC} --format fasta > refs/${ACC}.fa # <1>

# Retrieve GFF file
bio fetch ${ACC} --format gff > refs/${ACC}.gff  # <2>
```
1. Download the sequence file
2. Download the annotation file
