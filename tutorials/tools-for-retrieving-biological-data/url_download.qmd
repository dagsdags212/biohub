### How to download via URL

If you know the URL of a resource, you may use `wget` or `curl` to download the file.
```sh
# The URL of the file
URL=http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-104/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.22.fa.gz

# Download with curl
curl $URL > refs/chr22.fa.gz
```

  For large files, [aria2](https://aria2.github.io/) can do faster, multisegmented downloads that has the ability to restart interrupted downloads.
  
```sh
# The URL of the file
URL=http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-104/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.22.fa.gz

aria2 $URL > refs/chr22.fa.gz
# Download with aria2
```
